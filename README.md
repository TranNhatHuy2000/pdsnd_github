### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, you will make use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!

### Files used
-chicago.csv
-new_york_city.csv
-washington.csv

### The Datasets
The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

-Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
-End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
-Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
-Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
-End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
-User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
-Gender
-Birth Year

### Credits
I was able to complete this project by combining what I learnt from the Udacity course and by using R documentation. I used google and stackoverflow to search for error codes I encountered and asked for help from colleagues when necessary.
